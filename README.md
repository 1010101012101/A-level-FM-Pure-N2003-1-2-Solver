# A-level-FM-Pure-N2003-1-2-Solver
Solve the A-level further maths question N2003/1/2: The Python Way

This code attempts to solve a Cambridge International A-level further maths question with a rather crude brute-force method.

The initialized value is not 0 as that is too small for the program to find a solution in a short range of time.
Rather, the code initializes at a very large n-value to allow for quick convergence. 
The correct solution can be found within seconds.
